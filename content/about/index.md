This is the skeleton of the blog-to-be by Piraeus West Jr. a.k.a. Jupiter Swears. It will contain articles on every topic that interest me. There will be translations available in different languages for accessibility, but they will be translated by Google Translate, so bear with me. If you have suggestions on how to improve the language, feel free to file a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/JupiterSwears/JupiterSwearsBlog)

Professionally, I am a huge advocate of the Agile mindset. I will apply that to this blog too; if you have ideas on improvements of the style, content or language of the blog, please help me make things better. By commenting the article or submitting a pull request on GitHub.
