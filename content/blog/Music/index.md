# Cheap home music studio

## My music story

I recently discovered the joy of producing my own music. Having played the piano since the age of 5, I have been making music for my family to enjoy. But besides the occasional passerby, the rest of the world did not have access to my music. That has now changed, because I recorded, produced and published some of my originals on channels like:
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPkP_YEaGDWKo6UjEEQvHbg)
* [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jupiter-swears)
* [BandCamp](https://jupiter-swears.bandcamp.com/)

## Low cost, entry level studio setup

My music studio now consists of:
* M-Audio Keystation 61 MK3
* Boss RC-1 Loopstation
* Raspberry Pi 4
